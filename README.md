# ListOfImages-react

ListOfImages it is a react application that fetches list of images and display first 3 of them in the app using button "Next" . To create that project I used react technology and react-bootstrap.


## Install and run the app:

1. Install all dependencies using the command below:

 ```yarn install```  
 
 
2. To start the app, run the command:

  ```yarn start```

The application should be displayed automatically and this is the local address:


 ```http://localhost:300/```
