# ListOfImages React

ListOfImages is a [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) application that fetches list of images and displays first three in the app using the "Next" button.
To create this project I used React technology and [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap).

### Installation

Install dependencies using the command below.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Usage
 
To start the app run the following command.

```bash
yarn start
```

The application should be displayed automatically, this is the local address: `http://localhost:300/`
